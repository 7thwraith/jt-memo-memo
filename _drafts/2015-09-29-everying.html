<p>After K RETURN OF KINGS event, I rushed myself to Shibuyu to see every♥ing! This event was basically a talk show and a mini-live that lasted 1 hrs. Somehow me and @Allocer90 managed to get into 3時間目 that day. every♥ing! consists of Ibuki Kido and Yamazaki Erii. This was the first time seeing both girls in-person, and this event itself would help me prepare for Anisong Ichiban! in the following weeks.</p>
<h2>On the way to the Venue</h2>
<p>It took 1 hr to get to Shibuya from Yokohama. For some reason I completely forgot that Shibuya is quite busy city , and it took me awhile to get to the venue.  When I arrived at star lounge, there was already people waiting for the doors to open. 30 mins later I met up with @Allocer90. Before going in, staff pulled out a random ball with a number to determine who gets go inside the venue first. The number drawn by the staff member was #150, which meant whoever had a ticket number between #100-150 would proceed to go inside. Then people who had a number between #0-99 would proceed to go in after. Unfortunately for me and @Allocer90, we had numbers 88, and 90. When we got inside, there was a place to give presents to the girls. The venue itself was super small, but was p neat. No matter where you stood, you were quite close to Kido-chan and Erii-chan.</p>
<h2>Talk Corner</h2>
<p>Before every♥ing! came out, one of the staff members ask the crowd what girl do you oshi. At this moment of time, my mind was filled with the idea of seeing the girls within arm's length and forgot to raise my hand (whoops). A few moments later, every♥ing! came out and I was shocked how pretty the girls were. For this session, the girls wore parkas. You can check out Erii's blog post <a href="http://ameblo.jp/yamazaki-erii/entry-12078350547.html">here</a> and Kido's blog post <a href="http://ameblo.jp/kido-ibuki/entry-12078521270.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The girls basically did two game challenges: Which one do you prefer? and drawing contest</p>
<h3>Which one do you prefer?</h3>
<p>Basically Kido-chan and Erii-chan had to choose between A or B options during this challenge. (I did my best to remember the girls' choices below.)</p>
<h5><strong>A meal that had rice (A) or a meal that had dessert (B)?</strong></h5>
<p>Both girls choose A, but Kido-chan was making a big fuss about wanting the dessert too w.</p>
<h5><strong>Bungee Jumping (A) or Sky Diving (B)?</strong></h5>
<p>Kido-chan choose A, and Erii-chan choose B. Kido said sky diving was too scary and would prefer doing bungee jumping.</p>
<h5><strong>A pet alligator (A) or  a pet lion (B)?</strong></h5>
<p>Kido-chan choose A, and Erii-chan chose B. Kido would rather have a pet alligator because it was cool, while Erii picked the lion since it cuter.</p>
<p>There were more choices, but I can't seem to remember anymore even though it happens a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Drawing Contest</h3>
<p>For this challenge, the girls had 15 secs to look at whatever was on the screen and had to redraw it in a sketchbook to the best of their abilities. These are the following items the girls had to draw:</p>
<ul>
<li>a bicycle (Kido won)</li>
<li>a plane (Erii won)</li>
<li>a guitar (Erii won)</li>
<li>a bunch of fruits (Erii won)</li>
<li>a dolphin (Kido won)</li>
</ul>
<p>The best part of this challenge was that Kido-chan would make funny noises while drawing. Kido-chan would also finish before Erii-chan and immediately ask if she was done. Erii-chan would take her time and go at her own pace. Out of all the items they had to draw, the dolphin one was the most hilarious. Erii-chan's dolphin had the funniest eyes, the audience couldn't stop laughing when she showed us. The mini-live proceeded to happened after this challenge.</p>
<h2>Mini Live</h2>

<p>Everything about this mini live was AMAZING. Everyone was so close to the girls, and this small venue was very lively. The calls we did were so much fun, I can't explain it with words. Also, people in the crowd started to do the dance for the songs! It's a shame the live was short, but I enjoyed every second of it.</p>
<p>A owatashikai happened after the mini live. When it was my turn to get a bromide from the girls, I just told them they had fans in Canada.</p>
<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>This event was awesome, it's way different than your usual live. It had a chika idol feel too it, this was probably caused by the venue. If I had to describe the both girls in one word, I would say Kido-chan is a pro and Erii-chan is fluffy. Two different personalities that meshes well together. HoriPro did a great job scouting every♥ing! I will definitely will continue to support these two, and try to get into another event like this in the future.</p>
