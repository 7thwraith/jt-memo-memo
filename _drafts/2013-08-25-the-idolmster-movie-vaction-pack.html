<p>This week's merchandise (makes it sound like I have something every week even though I don't) involves movie tickets for the Idolm@ster anime film, THE IDOLM@STER MOVIE 輝きの向こう側 (The IDOLM@STER Movie: To the Glittering Other Side) that's going to be shown in Japan some time during the beginning of 2014.</p>
<p>THE IDOLM@STER MOVIE VAC@TION PACK!! is actually the second of limited-edition movie ticket bundles that were sold at THE IDOLM@STER 8th Anniversary Hop! Step!! Festiv@l that was held at <a href="http://l.i-mas.jp/8th/#pp-yokohama">Yokohoma </a>not that long ago (8.4.2013).</p>
<p>The first one went on sale at <a href="http://www.animecontentsexpo.jp/english/">Anime Contents Expo 2013</a>. Unfortunately, I missed my chance to procure one as the every movie pack they had in stock was apparently sold out within Day 01 of ACE2013. Needless to say, this is why I got the second movie pack instead.</p>
<p>The vac@tion pack consists the following:</p>
<h3>A clear storage case</h3>
<p>You know, it's wouldn't be farfetched to say that I might have gotten this because of that marvelous piece of artwork on the rear side of the case.</p>
<p><a style="text-align: center;" href="http://blog.7thwraith.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_0800.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-188 aligncenter" alt="IMG_0800" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0800-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<h3>Two tickets</h3>
<p>Now now, it won't be a ticket bundle if it weren't for tickets.</p>
<p>If anything, the tickets look so pretty that it might actually inhibit anyone from actually using it for admission to the theater.</p>
<h3>THE IDOLM@STER SUMMER VAC@TION REMIX!!</h3>
<p>This is the bonus CD containing background music from the movie. It contains three tracks:</p>
<ol>
<li>神SUMMER!! (BGM Ver.)<br />
[sc_embed_player fileurl="http://blog.7thwraith.net/wp-content/private_audio/01%20Track%2001.mp3"]</li>
<li>自分REST@RT (BGM Ver.)<br />
[sc_embed_player fileurl="http://blog.7thwraith.net/wp-content/private_audio/02%20Track%2002.mp3"]</li>
<li>私たちはずっと…でしょう? (BGM Ver.)<br />
[sc_embed_player fileurl="http://blog.7thwraith.net/wp-content/private_audio/03%20Track%2003.mp3"]</li>
</ol>
<p>If anything, there may be at least two more chances one can get one of these, and that would be during the remainder of THE IDOLM@STER 8th Anniversary Hop! Step!! Festiv@l that will be held in Fukuoka and Makuhari.		</p>
