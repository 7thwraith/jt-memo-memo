<h2>About</h2>
<p>I wanna be! (Waanabi.jk) is a 4 panel slice of life manga by Kenchi Kuroi, that mainly focuses on the dreams of 4 third-year girls at a private high school:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moraru Takatsuki (CV. Mikami Shiori)</li>
<li>Yumi Torii (CV. Terui Haruka)</li>
<li>Ami Yanagisawa (CV. Tokui Sora)</li>
<li>Mutsu Sasanaka (CV. Kusuda Aina)</li>
</ul>
<p>The project's concept was created by Tomoya Takahashi,  and character designs were made by Tetsuya Takeuchi. You can check out the MV <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQqw1eihiwU">here</a>.</p>
<h2>On the way to the Venue</h2>
<p>Waanabi.jk event was held at Kichijoji Theatre on 10/3/2015, that featured the cast of Mikami Shiori, Terui Haruka, Tokui Sora, Komatsu Mikako and Eguchi Nako. The venue itself was quite close to where I'm currently residing, and took 30 mins to walk to. When I arrived at Kichijoji Theatre at 9:40 am, there was already a line at the doors. For seating inside the theatre, it was suppose to be random. However, the staff made a executive decision and changed it first come, first served. I later met up with @Matteasu prior to doors opening and were given a Waanabi.jk DVD that came with the event ticket. We both had quite nice seats when we got inside the theatre (middle, row 4 from the stage). We were quite close to the cast when they appeared.</p>

<h2>Event</h2>
<p>Mikashii was basically the MC for this event, and was the first person to appear on stage. She said her greetings, then introduced Parunyasu, Soramaru, Mikakoshi, Nako-chan and Tomoya Takahashi to the stage. Sitting 4 rows from the stage, I was pretty amazed how pretty the girls were close up.</p>
<h4>Animation Short Film</h4>
<p>After introductions were done, a 10 minute video was shown to that give the audience a brief idea what Waanabi.jk was about. During this, Mikashii would interact with the girls. Sometimes she would tickle Parunyasu with Soramaru, or point to Mikakoshi depending on what was happening in the video.</p>
<h4>Talk Show</h4>
<p>Shortly after the video was finished, a 10 choices appeared on the screen. Only two were chosen by the audience and or cast.</p>
<p>The first choice was, "what kind of cosplay would you do?" and Mikashii, Soramaru and Parunyasu had to respond to this choice. Mikashii said she would cosplay as Jake, from Adventure Time. When it was Soramaru's turn, the cast just talked about her twitter avatar and how she was dressed up as Asuka from Evangelion. Sadly, I couldn't hear Parunyasu's response (sorry!).</p>
<p>The second choice that Mikakoshi and Nako-chan had to respond to was, "what do you do on your off days?". Mikakoshi and Nako-chan said they both played video games during their off time. I can't remember the name of the game Mikakoshi plays, but Nako-chan plays a lot of smartphone games.</p>
<h3>Afureko Corner</h3>
<p>Before this corner started, Parunyasu noticed her microphone wasn't secure on the mic holder and it was quite amusing to see her try to fix it.</p>
<p>Basically the plot for this corner was random, but it was great to see the cast person their lines in person. I noticed that Mikashii and Parunyasu were very lively and expressive, while Mikakoshi and Soramaru wouldn't fidget as much when acting. One of the highlights during this is when Mikashii played air guitar and did a huge jump at the end. It was so funny and unexpected, even the cast were surprised by the jump. They thought she would do a tiny jump, but the complete opposite happen lol. Also, Mikakoshi occasionally messing up her lines is great as always.</p>
<h3>Mini Live</h3>

</ol>
<p>Before performing, Nako-chan asked us to use the colour pink if you brought KBs to the live. The song itself is quite playful and upbeat; would listen again. After the live, Nako-chan said the other girls would be getting a character song, and hopefully perform them live in the near future.</p>
<h3>Janken</h3>
<p>After the mini live, we played janken with the girls and Tomoya Takahashi to win a prize. There were only 4 prizes, meaning there were only 4 chances to win. The rules were simple, beat the cast members and you win if you're the last man standing. If you lose or tie, you're out of the round. We faced the cast members in the rotation below:</p>
<p>Mikashii → Parunyasu → Soramaru → Mikakoshi → Nako-chan → Tomoya Takahashi</p>
<p>First round: I lost to Mikashii</p>
<p>Second round: I lost to Soramaru</p>
<p>Third round: I beat Nako-chan, lost to Tomoya Takashi</p>
<p>Fourth round: I beat Parunyasu, but lost to Soramaru</p>
<p>Basically, Soramaru was the gate keeper and I couldn't get to play with Mikakoshi... This was an amusing experience, and was hoping for either me or Matteasu to win a prize but that didn't happen.</p>
<p>After playing janken with the cast, one by one they said their good byes and thanked the audience for coming.</p>
<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>Even though this event only lasted an hour, it was very fun. Mikashii was a great MC; her interacting with the other girls made this event memorable. I only attended this event for the cast, but Waanabi.jk itself ain't so bad. Seeing the girls so close was great, and I want to attend the next Waanabi.jk event in the future. Too bad I couldn't go to the second session of the day, but it was fun nonetheless.</p>
