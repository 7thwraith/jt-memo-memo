<p>On 9/29/2015, I somehow managed to get into K RETURN OF KINGS afternoon session. The event consisted of Namikawa Daisuke, Komatsu Mikako, Tsuda Kenjiro, Kazuyuki Okitsu, Morita Masakazu, Horie Yui, Tomokazu Sugita, angela and カスタマイZ. To be honest I only attended this event to see Mikakoshi, and Okkii. When I bought the ticket, Hocchan and Sugita wasn't listed, and I was so surprised when the appeared. Anyways, it was a nice day at Pacifico and I attended this event alone.</p>
<h2>On the way to the Venue</h2>
<p>The commute took about 1.5 hrs to get to Pacifico Yokohama from Nerima. The venue itself was a 8 minute walk to get to, and it was my first time being here. I was running a bit late to the event, and I had trouble finding my seat. Before entering the hall, I noticed that there were no flower stands out. Maybe, they brought them out during the night session but who knows. There were multiple goods areas that mainly had BDs/CDs and character items. Also, they had a wall of character posters in the middle of the lobby. My seat number was 23, B43. This seat was actually decent, and had a nice view of the stage. There were also screens on each side of the stage for those who could see from the C block. Lastly, I would like to say the audience mainly consisted of 90% females in the hall.</p>
<h2>Wall of Posters</h2>

<h2>Teaser</h2>
<p>Before the event started, they showed a 20 minute pilot episode of the new season. The pilot episode introduced old and new characters to the show. Without spoiling anything, the only thing I wanted to say is that the quality in plot/PLOT has gone up compared to the previous season.</p>
<h2>Talk Corner</h2>
<p>Shortly after the pilot episode was done, the cast of K RETURN OF KINGS started to appear in the order below.</p>
<p>Namikawa Daisuke → Mikakoshi → Hocchan → Morita Masakazu→ Sugita →Okkii →Tsuda Kenjiro</p>
<p>One by one, they came out doing short gestures and wore outfits that resembled their character from the show. Mikakoshi obiviously did a neko pose when she was introduced. She wore a red neko hairband and a silky white one piece. Hocchan wore a red dress, Sugita wore all black with a hat, and Okkii wore green. The audience would cheer with their KBs and represented whatever King colour they supported. Namikawa Daisuke  and Mikakoshi rep'd silver, Hocchan rep'd red, Morita Masakazu and Sugita rep'd blue and lastly Okkii and Tsuda Kenjiro rep'd green.</p>
<p>After introductions were done, the game challenges began. The first challenge was basically a telephone game that had two rounds. The first round message involved the character Neko and food. Namikawa Daisuke started and Tsuda Kenjiro ended. When round was over, they failed to succeed in the challenge. The MC gave the cast another chance to redeem themselves and the second round began. The second round message had something to do with Anna and shopping. This time Tsuda Kenjiro opened and Namikawa Daisuke ended. The cast somehow managed to fail again. It was quite funny to see the interactions between the cast members as they were passing down the message. Some would laugh randomly and fall to the ground, and others couldn't believe what they're being told. Sugita was trolling everyone and it was quite the sight to see.</p>
<p>The second game challenge began shortly after. For this challenge, the cast had to appeal to the audience in their character voice.  The following below is the order that took place.</p>
<p>Tsuda Kenjiro → Okkii → Sugita → Morita Masakazu→ Hocchan→Mikakoshi→ Namikawa Daisuke</p>
<p>One by one, they took turns appealing to the audience. When Tsuda Kenjiro started to use his Suou Mikoto voice, even I felt wow'd. Out of all of them, I feel like Hocchan did it the best. Hearing Anna's voice was awesome. After this challenge was done, Hocchan and Mikakoshi went to get ready for the special live. In the meantime we were informed who was doing the OP/ED and show times of the new season. Hocchan is doing the new OP, and a small PV of asymmetry was shown.</p>
<h2>Special Live</h2>
<ol>
<li>堀江由衣 - アシンメトリー</li>
<li>小松未可子 - 冷たい部屋、一人</li>
<li>カスタマイZ - 解</li>
<li>angela - Different Colors</li>
<li>angela - KINGS</li>
</ol>
<p>I got to hear Hocchan's new song before it releases. The dance and outfit to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f4T8naTlTI">song</a> is quite nice, and there's part where Hocchan does a cute "chu" gesture. Mikakoshi performing to 冷たい部屋、一人 was treat to hear, since she did not do this at LIVE NEXUS. Mikakoshi just simply amazes me every time. カスタマイZ is basically a new anisong group to the industry and "解" is their debut single. The song itself isn't that bad and I can see myself listening to them in the future. Lastly, I wasn't expecting angela to be here; I cannot get tired of seeing them perform live. Katsu appeared with a Suou Mikoto cosplay going on, with his red hair. Atsuko also taught us calls for KINGS and it was a great time.</p>
<p>As soon as the special live finished, everyone said their good-byes and thanked the audience for attending.</p>
<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>I mainly went for Mikakoshi and Okkii. Any other guests that appeared at this event were just icing on the cake. I wasn't expecting Hocchan, Sugita, and angela to be here, but it was awesome to see them. Being able to see Sugita troll everyone in real time was hilarious. Tsuda Kenjiro voicing over Katsu was another highlight of this event. Too bad I couldn't make it to the night session, but I'm glad I was able to attend one of these sessions.</p>
