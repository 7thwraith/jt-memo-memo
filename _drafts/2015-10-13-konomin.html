<p>If you aren't a fan of Konomi Suzuki, you should become one asap. She's super talented at such a young age, and her voice range is amazing. She debuted in 2013 under Music Factory, and has won the fifth annual Animax Anison Grand Prix. If you're into anisong, you will like Konomin. This is my first Konomin live, and I was super excited when I found that I could attend one of her shows. Joining me at her Tokyo show is @Allocer90 and @matcha_p.</p>
<h2>On the way to the Venue</h2>
<p>It took 30 minute to get to Zepp Tokyo from Shinjuku. I was at Mikku's Birthday live prior to this, and I had to decide if I wanted to leave Mikku early or arrive late to Konomin. In the end, I decided to miss a bit of Konomin. Hopefully, I made the right choice. When I arrived at Zepp Tokyo, there was a small section for goods and flower stands. Since this live was not a seated event and I arrived late, I was lucky enough to be 10 rows away from the stage. If I had arrived on time, I would be near the back of the venue somewhere. To be honest, the view was amazing and I didn't deserve it.</p>
<h2>Flower Stands</h2>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Since I arrived 30 minutes late, I cannot comment on the first 9 songs that Konomin performed. Side note: she had a live band for this event.</p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>1. Open Heart</strong></p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>2. NOT PYGMALION</strong></p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>3. Tears BREAKER</strong></p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>4. Fly to the stars</strong></p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>5. DAYS of DASH</strong></p>
<div class="ttl">
<p class="ttl"><strong>6. 真聖輝のメタモルフォシス</strong></p>
<div class="ttl">
<p class="ttl"><strong>7. ごめんねのシンデレラ</strong></p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>8. 天体観測</strong></p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>9. 夢の続き</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">OP2 for the show Sakurasou. Since I missed out on DAYS of DASH, getting to hear this in person made up for it. Great song in general.</p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>10. 竜星鎮魂歌</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">A slow song that show cases Konomin's vocal ability well.</p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>11. LLL:CONNECTION</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">Very hype song that has fun calls to go with it. Konomin taught us the calls before performing the song. If you're curious, you too can learn the calls in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1LSfTnlaNk">video</a>.</p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>12. 星の名は絶望</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">Konomin, I...</p>
<div class="ttl">
<p class="ttl"><strong>13. Tomorrow's best</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">Another banger. Konomin continues to deliver and does not disappoint.</p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>14. 私がモテないのはどう考えてもお前らが悪い  鈴木このみ&amp;大石昌良）</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">I love watamote in general, and was so surprised when Kiba of Akiba made an appearance.  This song is sounded way better live compared to the studio version.</p>
<div class="ttl">
<p class="ttl"><strong>15. Nice to Me CHU!!!</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">Song title of the tour itself, and the first time hearing it.</p>
<div class="ttl">
<p class="ttl"><strong>16. 銀閃の風</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">One of my top favourite songs from Konomin in general. The live band for this song especially was amazing.</p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>17. Deep red heart</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">This song is quite up there with "Absolute Soul" in terms of hype.</p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>18. 囚人-Paradox 2013-</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">The hype train continues.</p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>19. CHOIR JAIL</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">OP for the show "Tasogare Otome x Amnesia". One of the crowd favourites fosho.</p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>20. AVENGE WORLD</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">If you seen Freezing, you would definitely know this song.</p>
<div class="ttl">
<p class="ttl"><strong>21. Absolute Soul -blade-</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">Konomin performing the OP for "Absolute Duo" was the one of the reasons I watched the show in the first place. One of the better songs in her discography.</p>
<div class="ttl">
<p class="ttl"><strong>22. This game</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">Konomin never ceases to amaze me.</p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>アンコール</strong></p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>23. オラシオン</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">No live band for this song, but I think it was fitting without it. This song itself showed why Konomin is so gooood.</p>
<p class="ttl"><strong>24. Before too long</strong></p>
<p class="ttl">Konomin surprised everyone by playing a guitar while singing!</p>

<h2>Misc.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Konomin had 3 outfits, and they were styled by a pro.</li>
<li>A female in the crowd was giving a letter from Konomin during the live.</li>
<li>Taiwan concert</li>
<li>New mini album called "18 -MORE-". You get a special bromide and clear file if you buy at the live.</li>
<li>Konomin getting trolled by the staff.</li>
<li>Frieza made a random appearence</li>
</ul>
<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>Konomin is awesome, and I think it would have been worth while if I left Mikku earlier to catch this live on time. I wasn't expecting a live band at this event, so that was a plus. Kinda wished I was able to get a concert shirt, but it sold out too fast. I guess this shows how popular Konomin is. I got to hear every song that I wanted expect "DAYS of DASH"... oh well. This live was fun nonetheless and I need to go to another one asap.</p>
