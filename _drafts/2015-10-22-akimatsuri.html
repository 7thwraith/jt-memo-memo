<p>Live Dam Company is a program that is hosted by Yoshioka Mayu and Tanaka Minami. Typically, it's a talk show with special guests that also has a small performance. You can watch episodes on YouTube too iirc. On 10/17/2015, they decided to have a Akimatsuri version of the program. Since both MCs are WUG! girls, I decided to take part in the first session. Joining me at this event is @garbej12 and @blitzwingjp.</p>
<h2>On the way to the Venue</h2>
<p>Prior to the event, I knew Blitz would be in Akiba quite early and line-up for buppan. So, I decided to head to Akiba a few hours earlier just to hang out with him. After chilling for a few hours, we headed over to Akiba Culture Zone. We arrived 30 minutes early to venue,  and found out you had to queue up depending on your ticket #. Good thing Blitz and I had numbers 61/62. Having a ticket number &lt;100 would almost guarantee you a seat inside. I think Blitz and I had seats in the 3rd row, which was super close to the stage.</p>
<h2>Talk Show</h2>
<p>The event started 30 minutes late, which 'caused me to be 15 minutes late to Lady Go!! later in day. Apparently, Mayuc said they were late because Minyami was busy eating. I highly doubt this was the case, but oh well. When the girls appeared onto the stage, I could immediately tell that Mayuc's blouse was somewhat transparent. Thank you based lighting crew. Hmm, both girls looked super cute in their hats/berets. They wore the same outfits from their pamphlet, which was kinda neat. After introductions were said and done, the game corner began.</p>
<h2>Game Corner</h2>
<p>The audience were the judges during this corner, and gave pts appropriately.</p>
<h3>Photo Contest</h3>
<p>The idea behind this contest, was to take a photo of a bento with a Autumn theme to it. Mayuc went first to take on this challenge. Minyami commented on Mayuc's photo by saying it was very instagram-like. When it was Minyami's turn, she tried to use the environment more in her photo.Since the audience were the judges, we had to vote on whose's photo was better. I personally voted on Mayuc, while Blitz voted for Minyami. It ended up as a draw for this round. Uh, you can see the both girl's photos below (Mayuc on the left, and Minyami on the right).</p>

<h2>Blind Taste Test</h2>
<p>The idea behind contest was to blind taste test a potato chip, and figure what which one you ate. A few minutes prior to the last challenge, there were 5 different types of potato chips laid on top of a table. Calbee, pringles and other notable brands. Minyami went first, but she had to wear some goofy glasses before starting.  Mayuc would choose what chip Minyami would eat, and feed her during this. A few minutes later of eating, Minyami was able to guess whatever chip she ate! Then it was Mayuc's turn to attempt this blind taste test. After Minyami chose what chip Mayuc would eat, Mayuc was quite stumped for a bit. In the end, Mayuc failed to figure out what chip she ate and Minyami was claimed the winner.</p>
<h2>Audience Requests</h2>
<p>For this round, people in the audience were allowed to submit requests before the event had started. The requests could have been anything within reason. The first request was for Minyami, where she had to say some slogan in a manly voice while eating a potato chip. The second request for Mayuc was to act like a ドS girlfriend. Since the entire audience was ドM, Mayuc was clearly the winner for this round.</p>
<p>tl;dr they went 1-1 in the game corner</p>
<h2>Drama</h2>
<p>Apparently Mayuc wrote the scripts for this segment. Basically, it was about their characters going to mini exhibit about Dragon Ball Z and other nonsense. Seeing Minyami voice act in person was quite impressive. You could tell that she capable of voicing other character types. Mayuc was just being Mayuc during this. After this drama bit was done, the live corner began.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p><strong>秋祭りカンパニー第1部セトリ</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Paradise Lost / 茅原実里 (吉岡茉祐)</strong></p>
<p>This song in amazing in general, and I think Mayuc did it justice in her cover. Mayuc can hit those notes fosho.</p>
<p><strong>2. Dream Parade / i☆Ris (田中美海)</strong></p>
<p>Minyami is also in Pripara, so her covering this song made sense. I knew there were i☆Ris fans in the audience when they started doing the mix for this.</p>
<p><strong>3. 花雪 / smileY inc. (吉岡茉祐)</strong></p>
<p>Good cover, but I think I prefer Yukachin's version a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>4. Raise / 小倉唯 (田中美海)</strong></p>
<p>Ah, Minyami is so goooood. She owned this song, and I completely forgot chanyui sings this originally.</p>
<p><strong>5. one by one (吉岡茉祐、田中美海)</strong></p>
<p>I thought this song was kinda generic and meh.</p>
<p><strong>6. after dark (吉岡茉祐、田中美海)</strong></p>
<p>This song was a lot better than one by one, since it was more EDM-ish. The pacing and tempo was a lot better too.</p>
<h3><strong>秋祭りカンパニー第2部セトリ</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. 恋は渾沌の隷也 / 後ろから這いより隊G (田中美海)</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. 謎 / 小松未歩 (吉岡茉祐)</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. LEVEL5 -judgelight- / fripSide (田中美海)</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Crow Song / Girls Dead Monster (吉岡茉祐)</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. one by one (吉岡茉祐、田中美海)</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. after dark (吉岡茉祐、田中美海)</strong></p>
<p>side-note: I didn't go to the 2nd session for this, so go bug @blitzwingjp about it</p>
<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>This event was super fun, and I kinda wished they had guests. Not sure why they started 30 mins late... I'm still kinda mad about that. However, I guess being so close to the girls made up for it. Also, seeing the girls outside WUG! was kinda refreshing too. Uh, I might need to Minyami after this... she was so amazing in general.</p>
