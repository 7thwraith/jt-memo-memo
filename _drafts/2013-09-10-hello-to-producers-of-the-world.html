<h3><del>Update 11 Sep 2013, 9:03 EDT: Form is temporarily closed. Need to reorganize stock. （*/∇＼*）</del></h3>
<p>==================================================================</p>
<p>How's it going, fellow Producers? I heard you like postcards so how about I send you one?</p>
<p>These are actually what's included in Official Idolm@ster 8th Live Calendar, part of the <a href="http://blog.7thwraith.net/?p=230"><em>THE IDOLM@STER 8th ANNIVERSARY HOP!STEP!!FESTIV@L!!!</em></a> items sold during the series of "lives". Now then....</p>
<ol>
<li>There are a total of thirty-six (postcards). Supplies are limited!</li>
<li>You may only acquire one card.</li>
<li>This is a first come, first serve basis.</li>
<li>You can queue up to two more selections for a total of three, just in case your first pick has already been claimed by someone else. If your second pick's been claimed, you'll get your third pick.</li>
<li>Each card has an ID. Make your selections using this ID. Claimed cards are assigned to their Twitter(?) handles</li>
<li>Please fill in the address section of the form as accurately as you can. We wouldn't want these wonderful postcards to get lost now, do we?</li>
<li>Also include an email address on the address section. <del>You'll be notified if any of your selections will be sent to you.</del> See Number 5.</li>
<li>Otherwise, better luck next time!</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we got that out of the way, TAKE YOUR PICK!</p>
