<p>If there's anything most noteworthy about Otakon this year, it's the deviation from how I'd usually alott my time. Whereas in previous Otakons (and I've only been in two excluding this one) were mostly spent on fan-made panels and just autograph sessions, this year was heavily spent on <strong>lining up</strong> and actually going to guest-related panels in conjunction with attending autograph sessions. I've also noticed that I haven't been going to the Dealer's Room as much as I have in the past. Artist Alley didn't even retain my interest maybe except for some of the items they have for the Charity Auction. I swear I saw an OreImo colored sketch of Ayase, Kuroneko, and Kirino there but don't seem to be present in the <a href="http://www.otakon.com/2013_charityauction.asp">official list</a>. I was going to  try my hand on getting one but I got distracted and totally forgot about it. Oh well.</p>
<h3><strong>Day 01</strong></h3>
<p>Though I keep hearing about the infamous LineCon that takes place in the West Coast, I've never actually been into one. However, I did have some existing preconceptions on what and how it would feel like to be one. The preconception was then realized on this day. We can blame this mainly on conflicting guest-related events of interest and the prerequisite of attaining a ticket for almost anything I came to this convention for.</p>
<p>As far as how the series of events progressed....</p>
<ul>
<li>Lining up for Yoko Kanno autograph tickets - <span style="color: #339966;">success</span></li>
<li>Lining up for T.M.R. autograph session - <span style="color: #ff0000;">failure</span></li>
<li>Lining up for Yoko Kanno concert tickets - <span style="color: #339966;">success</span></li>
<li>Lining up for Yoko Kanno autograph tickets - <span style="color: #339966;">success</span></li>
<li>Searching for an Idolm@ster photoshoot - <span style="color: #ff0000;">failure</span></li>
<li>Lining up for Home Made Kazoku autograph - <span style="color: #339966;">success</span>
<ul>
<li>Sidenote: I forget the fact that Micro and Kuro hail from the United States so when I heard their English, I was taken by surprise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Catching up to Twitter folks for late dinner for most and a drinking session for some</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fuckbasu&amp;src=hash&amp;mode=realtime">#fuckBasu</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Day 02</strong></h3>
<p>My morning was spent trying to help a few friends out with their private photoshoot by the inner harbor. But other than that....</p>
<ul>
<li>Surprise appearance by Ami/Mami cosplayers. Cosplayers are actual twins irl. Camera died "orz. Luckily, <a href="@NichiWillu">@NichiWillu</a> was there to take it, with a similar camera too.</li>
<li>Rendezvousing  with a few Twitter folks @ Hiroyuki Kanbe early enough to catch two of then win from a raffle some OreImo goods signed by Kanbe himself</li>
<li>Tomokazu Seki panel or Q&amp;A or voice acting request or confession session, whatever floats your boat
<ul>
<li>Sidenote: Although it made the whole program interesting, some of the audience's questions are a bit unreserved and inconsiderate to say the least</li>
<li>Sidenote: I applaud Seki for putting a comic spin on his responses despite sidenotes above</li>
<li><a href="http://i.mixcloud.com/CDANIG">Audio recording of the whole panel</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lining up for Chiaki Ishikawa autograph</li>
<li>Home Made Kazoku + T.M.R. concert
<ul>
<li>Sidenote: It's a shame that a bunch of us were not able to make it to the first half of the concert when HMK was performing. We spent that time lining up for Chiaki Ishikawa's autograph instead</li>
<li>Sidenote: T.M.R.'s attire is flambuoyant as I imagined (is that a female's tanktop he's wearing?). Doesn't matter. He looks surprisingly good in it.</li>
<li>T.M.R. did sing Preserved Roses. <del>We the audience were singing as Mizuki Nana. Just kidding.</del> Mizuki Nana's part was pre-recorded</li>
<li>Songs sung that I recognized included both Gundam Seeds, Soul Eater, Rurouni Kenshin, Sengoku Basara etc.</li>
<li>Concert finale is a collab between HMK and T.M.R.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ran into Takane and Hibiki cosplayers in Ai Like Hamburger attires. Learnt that the original photoshoot scheduled for Day 01 actually happened on Day 02 and organized by the Ami/Mami cosplayers I ran into earlier.</li>
<li>Spent the rest of the evening playing Riichi Mahjong in the game room</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Day 03</strong></h3>
<p>It kind of sucks when you "own" the hotel room as I had to stay back to be the last man out. In any case...</p>
<ul>
<li>Going to the Dealer's Room for a scheduled HMK photograph session - <span style="color: #ff0000;">failure</span>
<ul>
<li>Apparently the Dealer's Room was so packed that they capped the line for fear of it becoming a "fire hazard"</li>
<li>Sidenote: Also, why Dealer's Room?!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lining up for Chiaki Ishikawa / Yoko Kanno concert. <a href="https://twitter.com/7thwraith/status/366582107952259072">NO, not that Yoko</a>.
<ul>
<li>As I came from a failed attempt to enter the Dealer's Room, I wasn't able to secure as good as a spot as I had last year</li>
<li>Line Ops seem spatially and geometrically challenged</li>
<li>Describing Con Ops and their absolutely no electronics policy (not just recording devices, mind you) as strict is insufficient</li>
<li>Sidenote: I forgot to turn off my Bluetooth headset which apparently blinked like fireworks to Con Ops. Thankfully, I was able to conceal it with a sleight of hand</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chiaki Ishikawa concert segment
<ul>
<li>I particularly listen to her songs if I wanted to detach my mind and send it off to another world, so to speak. Her concert did exactly just that</li>
<li>Those background flicks that were playing on the screen concurrently as she was performing contributed even more to the point above</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yoko Kanno concert segment
<ul>
<li>Those experimental live visuals (as they call it) that were projected on the piano and sycned to the musical piece that was playing at that time was something to behold</li>
<li>Notable pieces include TANK!, Gravity, The Real Folk Blues, Memory of Fanelia, and even Star-Spangled Banner (because America!)</li>
<li>There were two pieces that struck me deep but unfortunately couldn't recognize. One of them was played during the projection of a "duckling" as part of the visuals. The other one was towards the end during the playing of  credits. The latter particularly almost brought me tears.</li>
<li>Gravity and The Real Folk Blues were two songs that had the most audience sing-in participation. Gravity is no-brainer as the lyrics were completely in English but TRFB was most amusing as most of the audience only sang in the chorus when the lyrics read "THE REAL FOLK BLUES"
<ul>
<li>Sidenote: you know, if we only had our phones to look up the lyrics...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Over all, her concert brought back good memories and even deeper meaning to the songs I only recognized. There's so much more to her concert that I simply cannot contain it in a couple of statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Loot</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Producer Stuff</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Days before the Otakon, I've been informed that there was going to be an Idolm@ster Photoshoot Meetup originally scheduled for Friday. I went to the designated location but nobody was there. I found out later that it was postponed to Saturday...too late</li>
<li>I met a <a href="http://twitter.com/digikerot">Twitterfolk Producer from UK</a>!</li>
<li>I went biking without a bike. Two YayoiPs apparently felt the same way. Too bad I wasn't able to find them</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I met a lot of East Coast Ps, BUT NONE OF THEM HAD TWITTER!</li>
<li>876 Producers DO EXIST</li>
<li>I still managed to find my idols &lt;3</li>
</ul>
