<p>I guess I’ll start by saying that if there any good time to see Sumipe and Mikakoshi, this is definitely one of them. This is their first 2 man concert live they had together, and hopefully not the last. Being a huge fan of both artists, I definitely had to attend. Joining me at this live is @Allocer90, @matcha_p, @LandRoverAttack and @Matteasu.</p>
<h2>On the way to the Venue</h2>
<p>This live event was held at the Yebisu Garden Place on 9/26/2015, and was like a 10ish minute walk from the station. This was my first time being here, and I was kinda overwhelmed by the architecture. The environment had a classy and modern feel, and was quite nice to experience it. While waiting for the event to start, I headed to the buppan line to buy the pamphlet and bromides of Sumipe and Mikakoshi. There was little to no line for goods, and you could have bought live tickets at the door too if you didn't have them already! After meeting the gang, we all went our separate ways to line up to enter the venue. Matteasu and I bought tickets together, and were placed around C141. The venue itself was quite small instead, and I had difficult time seeing the stage half the time. By being somewhat close to the back, I kinda wished they had screens on the side.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>The live was separated into 3 segments (Sumipe, Mikakoshi, Encore).</p>
<h4>上坂すみれ</h4>
<ul>
<li>Inner Urge</li>
<li>キャラメル桃ジャム120％</li>
<li>OS宇宙人 (cover)</li>
<li>げんし、じょしは、たいようだった</li>

</ul>
<h4>小松未可子</h4>
<ul>
<li>終わらないメロディーを歌いだしました</li>
<li>LISTEN!</li>
<li>トウキョウ・ミッドスカイ</li>
<li>群青サバイバル</li>
<li>Happy Girl (cover)</li>
<li>Black Holy</li>
</ul>
<h4>すみこし Encore</h4>
<ul>

<li>パララックスビュー</li>
<li>夏至の果実</li>
<li>お後がよろしくってよ</li>
<li>Happy Girl</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a fantastic set list, and am grateful to hear to these songs in-person. The girls teasing each other in between their MC, and the outfits they wore made this event very enjoyable. Mikakoshi forgetting the lyrics to お後がよろしくってよ was a funny sight to see. I was hoping for them to cover each other songs (Sumipe doing Black Holy, and Mikakoshi doing Inner Urge) but that unfortunately didn't happen. Also,  the cheers people were yelling before the encore segment was luls. Different parts of the venue were yelling "MI-KA-KO-SHI", "SU-MI-PE", and "KA-WA-II". Matteasu and, I were apart of the"KA-WA-II" group.</p>
<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>If StarChild decides to do this event again, I'll definitely be there. Mikakoshi said there might be a 4 man live in the near future, hopefully KitaEri, Sugar or Hocchan will take part. Sumikoshi make a wonderful combination together. Hopefully Sacchan isn't mad that Sumipe is getting close to Mikakoshi lol.</p>
<p>I had an enjoyable time at this event, even though I couldn't see the stage half the time. It was so good, I had to buy a live t-shirt when it was over lol. Seeing both Sumipe and Mikakoshi collaborating together is a rare occasion and I'm glad I went.</p>
