<p>As you can tell by the title, this event was Mikku's 1st solo live on her birthday. There were two sessions that day called "~WONDERLAND / LOOKING GLASS~". The major theme/concept of this event was based on Alice in Wonderland. I was only able to do the afternoon session, since I planned to go to a Konomin live later that evening.</p>
<h2>On the way to the Venue</h2>
<p>I was with @houkoholic in Akiba prior to going to Shinjuku ReNY. It took 39 mins to get to the venue itself, and it was kinda difficult to find. There was a small sign telling you to go to the 2nd floor to enter the venue. As soon as you got inside, you would immediately see a bunch of flower stands for Mikku. Also, there was a small table just for goods selling towels, t-shirts and pamphlets. Since this event was a first come first serve, your place inside the hall depended in how early you camped. My placement inside the hall was kinda near the back, but I still had a decent view of the stage. I think they oversold on this event, since it was so packed. There were people standing in between the doors that separated the hall and venue itself...</p>
<h2>Flower Stands</h2>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p><strong>1. ミライファンファーレ</strong></p>
<p>OP for the show Locodol. This was a solo version, but normally it would have Sacchan too.</p>
<p><strong>2. さきどりドリーマー</strong></p>
<p>Another character song from the show Locodol.</p>
<p><strong>3. Take you to my party for you!!</strong></p>
<p>ED for Million Doll. Go check out the show, it's not that bad w</p>
<p><strong>4. 赤いスイートピー</strong></p>
<p>A classic, you'll probably recognize it when you hear it.</p>
<p><strong>5. マジレンジャーOP</strong></p>
<p>OP for Mahou Sentai Magiranger.</p>
<p><strong>6. Climax Jump</strong></p>
<p>Mikku's cover for this song was amazing, such energy.</p>
<p><strong>7. シンケンジャーOP (新曲)</strong></p>
<p>Yoffy was a surprise guest for this song, and they did a collab. It was super duper cool.</p>
<p><strong>8. 星鳴る夜の誘惑者</strong></p>
<p>I was wondering when Mikku would do a StylipS song, and then it finally happened. I thought Moeshi or Nocchi would make a appearance but nope.</p>
<p><strong>9. 純粋なフジュンブツ</strong></p>
<p>One of the better StylipS songs imo. Watching Mikku do the dance for this was mesmerizing.</p>
<p><strong>10. Thank You!</strong></p>
<p>As soon as this song came on, you could tell everyone in the room was a Producer lol.</p>
<p><strong>11. Dear Honesty</strong></p>
<p>Mikku ended the the live with her StylipS solo song.</p>
<h2>Food Challenge</h2>
<p>After every 3-4 songs, Mikku would change outfits and a video will be played on the screen. Basically the idea of this challenge was to taste test two servings of 'x' food and see which one of the two was the more expensive one. She had to choose between "Try this!" and "Eat me!".</p>
<p>The 1st round involved tofu. One being priced at 800円 and the other one at 105円. Mikku was able to guess which tofu was the expensive one based off the texture!</p>
<p>The 2nd round involved tomago gohan. One being priced at 880円 and the other one at 305円. Mikku thought the cheaper one tasted better and failed this round.</p>
<p>The 3rd round involved sashimi. One being priced at 2150円 and the other one at ~580円. Between the two, one was more red than the other. Based on that logic and after eating it, she thought the one that was more red was the expensive one. Turns out she was wrong and failed this round.</p>
<p>The 4th round involved grilled meat. One being priced at 2300円 and the other at ~590円. Between the two, one did not look that appetizing compared to the other. But after she tasted the less appetizing one, she knew fosho that it was the more expensive one. Mikku passed the final round!</p>
<p>Seeing Mikku eating food was quite amusing and hilarious at the same time.</p>
<p>tl;dr she went 2:4 in this challenge</p>
<h2><strong>Misc.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Stage had a Alice in Wonderland theme, there was even a tea table on stage!</li>
<li>Cheshire Cat was the MC for this event nyaaaa</li>
<li>Mikku had 3 outfits this event: Her Alice outfit, Bunny outfit, and Queen outfit.</li>
<li>We sang happy birthday to Mikku</li>
<li>Then we sang Happy birthday to Yoffy, since his BD was a day before Mikku</li>
<li>Mikku is now in yomecolle now!</li>
<li>Moeshi and Nocchi was at the event on the 2nd floor somewhere.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Closing Remarks</strong></h2>
<p>Ah, Mikku is such a good girl. Her smile and personality are just the best. If I had to quote a wise DD, it would be "I chose correct". You don't get the chance to attend someone's 1st live and it being on her birthday that often. It only happens once, and I'm glad I went. It's a shame that the Moeshi or Nocchi didn't perform with her, oh well. I liked how she was able to cover super sentai songs, and was able to just be herself on stage. Will definitely try for her 2nd live if the stars align.</p>
