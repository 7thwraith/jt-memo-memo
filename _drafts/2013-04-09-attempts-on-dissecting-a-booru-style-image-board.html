<p>The concept of a booru-style image board has always fascinated me. What would normally be just a regular image gallery is now suddenly one of the hubs for anime/manga-esque images (high-quality resolutions at that too) as well as what seems to me as an instigator to a whole new subculture formed by the marriage of animango and the internets (more specifically, the web's underlying technologies).</p>
<p>I can talk to you all day about how uber-awesome boorus are, but what exactly makes a booru-style distinctive from all the image galleries/boards available across the web?</p>
<p>Wikipedia has the following to say</p>
<blockquote><p>...Danbooru and derivatives aim for a non-hierarchical semantic structure in which users are able to post content and add tags, annotations, translations, and comment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems legitimate. It's a comprehensive summary of how it functions but....not really helpful if you're trying to build a booru-style image board from scratch. If anything, I would probably start by enumerating the important (at least the ones that I deem importabt)  microfunctions of the site.</p>
<p>Let's start with the original booru-style image board, Danbooru.</p>
<p>Note that this list is not complete. Some features are omitted, others have yet to be identified. I will be adding to this list over time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.7thwraith.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/danbooru_search_results.png"><img class="wp-image-58 aligncenter" title="Danbooru's Search Result Page" alt="danbooru_search_results" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/danbooru_search_results-1024x622.png" width="614" height="373" /></a></p>

</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.7thwraith.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/danbooru_single_post.png"><img class="wp-image-57 aligncenter" title="A single danbooru post" alt="danbooru_single_post" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/danbooru_single_post-1024x622.png" width="614" height="373" /></a></p>

<p>If you have not guessed yet, I plan to build a booru-style image board using CMS platform. The list above will be my guidelines. I will be elaborating more on this project but I shall save that for another post.</p>
